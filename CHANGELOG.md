- Settings page for customization

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- Popup now shows an "in progress" list of every active download (not just the book matching the current tab), so switching pages mid-download no longer hides its progress
- Confirmation prompt before starting a second download while another book is already downloading, to avoid silently doubling concurrent network load
